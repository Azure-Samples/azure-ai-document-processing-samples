# Extraction Samples

This folder contains samples that demonstrate how to extract structured data from documents using Azure AI services.

> [!NOTE]
> All data extraction samples provide both an accuracy and confidence score for the extracted data. The accuracy score is calculated based on the similarity between the extracted data and the ground truth data. The confidence score can be calculated based on OCR analysis confidence and `logprobs` in Azure OpenAI responses.
