    "# Document Classification with Azure OpenAI's GPT-4o Vision Capabilities\n",

    "This sample demonstrates how to classify a document using Azure OpenAI's GPT-4o model with vision capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Data Classification](../../../images/classification-openai.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is achieved by the following process:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define a list of classifications, with descriptions and keywords.\n",
    "- Construct a system prompt that defines the instruction for classifying document pages.\n",
    "- Construct a user prompt that includes the defined classifications, and each document page as an base64 encoded image.\n",
    "- Use the Azure OpenAI chat completions API with the GPT-4o model to generate a classification for each document page as a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this sample, you will have learned how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Convert a document into a set of base64 encoded images for processing by GPT-4o.\n",
    "- Use prompt engineering techniques to instruct GPT-4o to classify a document's pages into predefined categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Useful Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "- Combine this technique with a [page extraction](../extraction/README.md) approach to ensure that you extract the most relevant data from a document's pages."

    "### Understanding Accuracy vs Confidence\n",
    "\n",
    "When using AI to classify data, both confidence and accuracy are essential for different but complementary reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accuracy** measures how close the AI model's output is to a ground truth or expected output. It reflects how well the model's predictions align with reality.\n",
    "  - Accuracy ensures consistency in the classification process, which is crucial for downstream tasks using the data.\n",
    "- **Confidence** represents the AI model's internal assessment of how certain it is about its predictions.\n",
    "  - Confidence indicates that the model is certain about its predictions, which can be a useful indicator for human reviewers to step in for manual verification.\n",
    "\n",
    "High accuracy and high confidence are ideal, but in practice, there is often a trade-off between the two. While accuracy cannot always be self-assessed, confidence scores can and should be used to prioritize manual verification of low-confidence predictions."
