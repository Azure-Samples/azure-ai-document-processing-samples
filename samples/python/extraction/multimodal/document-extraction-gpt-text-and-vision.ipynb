    "# Document Extraction using Multi-Modal (Text and Vision) Capabilities combining Azure AI Document Intelligence and Azure OpenAI's GPT-4o\n",
    "\n",
    "This sample demonstrates how to build a comprehensive process to extract structured data from any document using Azure AI Document Intelligence and Azure OpenAI's GPT-4o model with vision capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Data Extraction](../../../../images/extraction-comprehensive.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is achieved by the following process:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analyze a document using Azure AI Document Intelligence's `prebuilt-layout` model to extract the structure as Markdown.\n",
    "- Construct a system prompt that defines the instruction for extracting structured data from documents.\n",
    "- Construct a user prompt that includes the specific extraction instruction for the type of document, the text content, and each document page as a base64 encoded image.\n",
    "- Use the Azure OpenAI chat completions API with the GPT-4o model to generate a structured output from the content.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this sample, you will have learned how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Convert a document to Markdown format using Azure AI Document Intelligence.\n",
    "- Convert a document into a set of base64 encoded images for processing by GPT-4o.\n",
    "- Use prompt engineering techniques to instruct GPT-4o to extract structured data from a type of document.\n",
    "- Use the [Structured Outputs feature](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/structured-outputs?tabs=python-secure) to extract structured data from the document page images using Azure OpenAI's GPT-4o model.\n",
    "- Use the analysis result from Azure AI Document Intelligence to determine the confidence of the extracted structured output.\n",
    "- Use the [logprobs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/reference#request-body:~:text=False-,logprobs,-integer) parameter in an OpenAI request to determine the confidence of the extracted structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Useful Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "- Combine this technique with a [page classification](../../classification/README.md) approach to reduce the number of pages to extract from to only those that match your criteria for extraction."

    "To provide context for the execution of the code, the following code blocks visualize the outputs of the data extraction process.\n",
    "\n",
    "This includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The accuracy of the structured data extraction comparing the expected output with the output generated by Azure OpenAI's GPT-4o model.\n",
    "- The confidence score of the structured data extraction based on combining the confidence scores of the Azure AI Document Intelligence layout analysis and the log probability of the output generated by Azure OpenAI's GPT-4o model.\n",
    "- The execution time of the end-to-end process.\n",

    "### Understanding Accuracy vs Confidence\n",
    "\n",
    "When using AI to extract structured data, both confidence and accuracy are essential for different but complementary reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accuracy** measures how close the AI model's output is to a ground truth or expected output. It reflects how well the model's predictions align with reality.\n",
    "  - Accuracy ensures consistency in the extraction process, which is crucial for downstream tasks using the data.\n",
    "- **Confidence** represents the AI model's internal assessment of how certain it is about its predictions.\n",
    "  - Confidence indicates that the model is certain about its predictions, which can be a useful indicator for human reviewers to step in for manual verification.\n",
