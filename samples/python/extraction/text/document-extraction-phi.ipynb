    "# Document Extraction with Azure AI Document Intelligence and Microsoft Phi-4 (Text Only)\n",
    "\n",
    "This sample demonstrates how to extract structured data from any document using Azure AI Document Intelligence and Microsoft's Phi-4 model.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Data Extraction](../../../../images/extraction-document-intelligence-phi.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is achieved by the following process:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analyze a document using Azure AI Document Intelligence's `prebuilt-layout` model to extract the structure as Markdown.\n",
    "- Construct a system prompt that defines the instruction for extracting structured data from documents.\n",
    "- Construct a user prompt that includes specific extraction instruction for the type of document, the expected JSON schema, and the Markdown content of the document\n",
    "- Use the chat completions API with the Phi-4 model to generate a structured output from the content.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this sample, you will have learned how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Convert a document to Markdown format using Azure AI Document Intelligence.\n",
    "- Use prompt engineering techniques to instruct Phi-4 to extract structured data from a type of document using example JSON structures.\n",
    "- Use the analysis result from Azure AI Document Intelligence to determine the confidence of the extracted structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Useful Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "- Combine this technique with a [page classification](../../classification/README.md) approach to reduce the number of pages to extract from to only those that match your criteria for extraction."

    "- **Confidence** represents the AI model's internal assessment of how certain it is about its predictions.\n",

    "\n",
