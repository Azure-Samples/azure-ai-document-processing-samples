    "# Data Extraction - Comprehensive Azure AI Document Intelligence + Azure OpenAI GPT-4o with Vision\n",
    "\n",
    "This sample demonstrates how to build a comprehensive process to extract structured data from any document using Azure AI Document Intelligence and Azure OpenAI's GPT-4o model with vision capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Data Extraction](../../../images/extraction-comprehensive.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is achieved by the following process:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analyze a document using Azure AI Document Intelligence's `prebuilt-layout` model to extract the structure as Markdown.\n",
    "- Construct a system prompt that defines the instruction for extracting structured data from documents.\n",
    "- Construct a user prompt that includes the specific extraction instruction for the type of document, the text content, and each document page as a base64 encoded image.\n",
    "- Use the Azure OpenAI chat completions API with the GPT-4o model to generate a structured output from the content.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this sample, you will have learned how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Convert a document to Markdown format using Azure AI Document Intelligence.\n",
    "- Convert a document into a set of base64 encoded images for processing by GPT-4o.\n",
    "- Use prompt engineering techniques to instruct GPT-4o to extract structured data from a type of document.\n",
    "- Use the [Structured Outputs feature](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/structured-outputs?tabs=python-secure) to extract structured data from the document page images using Azure OpenAI's GPT-4o model.\n",
    "- Use the analysis result from Azure AI Document Intelligence to determine the confidence of the extracted structured output.\n",
    "- Use the [logprobs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/reference#request-body:~:text=False-,logprobs,-integer) parameter in an OpenAI request to determine the confidence of the extracted structured output."

    "- **modules.openai_confidence** to calculate the confidence of the classification process based on the `logprobs` response from the API request.\n",

    "- **Accuracy** measures how close the AI model's output is to a ground truth or expected output. It reflects how well the model's predictions align with reality.\n",

    "- **Confidence** represents the AI model's internal assessment of how certain it is about its predictions.\n",
    "  - Confidence indicates that the model is certain about its predictions, which can be a useful indicator for human reviewers to step in for manual verification.\n",
    "\n",
    "High accuracy and high confidence are ideal, but in practice, there is often a trade-off between the two. While accuracy cannot always be self-assessed, confidence scores can and should be used to prioritize manual verification of low-confidence predictions."
