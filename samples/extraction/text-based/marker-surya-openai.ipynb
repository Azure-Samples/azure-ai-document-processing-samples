    "- The Markdown representation of the document structure as determined by Marker and Surya OCR.\n",

    "- **Accuracy** measures how close the AI model's output is to a ground truth or expected output. It reflects how well the model's predictions align with reality.\n",
    "  - Accuracy ensures consistency in the extraction process, which is crucial for downstream tasks using the data.\n",
    "- **Confidence** represents the AI model's internal assessment of how certain it is about its predictions.\n",
    "  - Confidence indicates that the model is certain about its predictions, which can be a useful indicator for human reviewers to step in for manual verification.\n",
    "\n",
    "High accuracy and high confidence are ideal, but in practice, there is often a trade-off between the two. While accuracy cannot always be self-assessed, confidence scores can and should be used to prioritize manual verification of low-confidence predictions."
